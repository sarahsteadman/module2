# Overview

Welcome to the Dragon Planner! On this webpage you can add tasks to a checklists. Each task may be broken down into subtasks to mark your progress. When you complete a task, your dragon buddy gets a snack!

I had two purposes for creating this webpage. I wanted to use this webpage to help me learn how to write code in Typescript. I also wanted a fun task planner, that would help me to mark small steps towards a larger goal.

# Development Environment

Tools used for this project:

Node, 
VS code, 
Git Bash

This page was created with Typescript. Typescript is a superset of Java that has static typing and is also strongly typed. By being strongly typed, Typescript helps developers to prevent major problems in the future, by enforcing more rules while the code is being written. It provides the helpful ability to see and fix errors before runtime.
